############LAMMPS EMULATOR version 1h####################
#08-05-2018

(A) DESCRIPTION
A coupled-emulator which produces rates of change of nutrient concentrations namely 
(nh3,no2,no3,o2,co2) and rates of change of the following characterized outputs
(Biomass concentration for each particle, the total number of particles for each species, Biofilm height) respectively.
For instance, dH/dt=(H_2-H_1)/(T_2-T_1)

###14 outputs
(i) Rate of change of SUB/Carbon substrate concentration (kg/m3)
(ii) Rate of change of O2 concentration (kg/m3)
(iii) Rate of change of NO2 concentration (kg/m3)
(iv) Rate of change of NO3 concentration (kg/m3)
(v) Rate of change of NH4 concentration (kg/m3)
(vi) Rate of change of biomass for HET (kg)
(vii) Rate of change of biomass for AOB (kg)
(viii) Rate of change of biomass for NOB (kg)
(ix) Rate of change of biomass for EPS (kg)
(x) Rate of change of biofilm total number of particle for HET (unitless)
(xi) Rate of change of biofilm total number of particle for AOB (unitless)
(xii) Rate of change of biofilm total number of particle for NOB (unitless)
(xiii) Rate of change of biofilm total number of particle for EPS (unitless)
(xiv) Rate of change of biofilm average height (m)

(B) All required data and C++ scripts for the emulator are in the directory "LAMMPS_emulator_V1h". 
The main c++ source code is "emu.cpp". 

(C) Input file description:
A sample "input.txt" file is placed in the "input" subfolder which is a required input parameters for running the emulator.
This contain 14 different values
The input values [1..5] represent "SUB","O2","NO2","NO3","NH4" local nutrient substrates (mol/L) respectively. 
The input values [6..14] represent current values of "Biomass concentration for each species","total number of particle for each species","Biofilm height".

(D) RUN the code:
The main source code is "emu.cpp". The emulator can be run from either the Window or Linux platform. 
Put the input file "input.txt" to be run in the subfolder "input". These files contain the parameter values and initial conditions.
To run any case, the input parameters must be converted to the units stated above to get correct results.

To run from Linux terminal:
$ cd path to /LAMMPS_emulator_V1h
/** compile .cpp file
$ g++ -O3 -I/usr/include/eigen3/ emu.cpp -o emu
/** run the code as
$ ./emu

(E) Obtain the simulation results from subfolder "output".

(F) The valid ranges of the nutrient concentrations (kg/m3) and other parameters:
       "SUB"         "O2"      "NO2",         "NO3"        "NH4"        "Biomass_HET"  "Biomass_AOB"  "Biomass_NOB"  "Biomass_EPS"   "HET"     "AOB"  "NOB"  "HET"      "Height"
